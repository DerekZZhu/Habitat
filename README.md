Many people want to start new helpful habits, such as sleeping on time or writing in a daily journal. However, they often fail within a few weeks because they lack enough accountability or motivation to keep up before their actions become a habit. 

Common knowledge says it takes a month (~28 days) to build a habit before it sticks (although it is possible, it is more difficult to lose a habit afterward). Habitat aims to model the growth of a habit through plants. 

As a user’s habit becomes more solidified, their plant also grows on their screen. The plant’s growth motivates users to keep up their new habits (nobody wants to see a plant die; they want to see it grow). Nor does the plant trick the user into being more productive because it models the start of a new habit — a seedling that has been planted that the user must nurture if they want it to develop. Such a comparison forms the basis of our app.
